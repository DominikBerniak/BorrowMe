# BorrowMe

## Story
Let's assume that you have just bought an apartament at a bargain price. It was cheaper for one, simple reason - it is whole for renovation. You still want to save as much money as possible, so you ask your handyman uncle to help. He readily agrees, but there's one problem. He doesn't have any tools. So, where to get them? You're not going to buy it, duuuuh...
What if you borrowed them?
